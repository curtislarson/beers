## Untappd Data Preparation

Getting all the data I wanted for each checkin without having to ad hoc query the Untappd API was a bit of a task. Thankfully Untappd provides an [export feature for insiders](https://help.untappd.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034506171-Where-can-I-find-the-Exportable-Data-feature-) which got me almost there. However the export does not have beer image labels and its sent to an email address which would have been a pain to write a connector for that.

Instead I ran an initial export to retrieve the bulk of my data and queried the `beer_url` link for each checkin and extracted the `og:image` meta tag to retrieve the beer label url. I stored the `beer_id`, `image_url` combo in a cockroachdb database for safe keeping until I was ready to add it to the rest of the JSON data. This took a bit of time and I had to use some backoff logic to prevent getting requests denied. Not sure if there was a better way for the amount of data that I needed to fetch.

Even with the export complete I still needed a method to periodically hit the Untappd api to retrieve checkins that occurred since the initial export. That just ended up being a simple scheduled github action that hit the [User Activity Feed](https://untappd.com/api/docs#useractivityfeed) api. Thankfully that api returns beer image labels along with the rest of the information I needed. I couldn't just use that api to pull all data because it limits you to the most recent `200` or so checkins from what I remember.

The GitHub action that hit the api would add any new entries to the json data file, create a PR, and then merge the PR into the repo. That would in turn trigger a deployment so the website now had the ability to update itself.

## Trip Data

Fortunately i've been a member of [Nomad List](https://nomadlist.com/) for quite a few years and have kept my travel profile up to date. They allow you to export all your trips to a `json` file which just needed a bit of data cleaning before I could integrate it.

At the moment it's currently being used for the "Select A Trip" dropdown filter. You select a trip in the dropdown and it will filter all the currently displayed checkins on both the map and the list view to only the ones contained in that list. It also will set the map view to the `lat`/`lng` coordinates of that trip.

The data only goes back 3 or so years though so I'll need to backfill some of the location ata at some point. Likely just in my nomadlist profile so I don't have to include any extra data handling logic.

## TODO

- [ ] Some sort of "navigation" or "auto driver" mode where it slowly goes from beer to beer and navigates around the map? Similar to the 1000 beer party.
- [ ] Use purchased location if it exists and venue location does not exist or is untappd at home
- [ ] Remove "X days ago" from location filter or think of better alternative
- [ ] Improve markers?
- [ ] Sort fields
- [ ] Keyword highlighting?
- [ ] Include "globe view"?
  - Would need to relearn `kml`

- [x] Fix mobile styles
- [x] Connect cloudflare pages to github and verify deployment
- [x] Fetch images from urls and upload to blob store
- [x] Deploy scheduled job to pull incrementally (default last 50 beers should be good enough)
- [x] Have filter for checkins based on the current trip
- [x] Convert nomadlist trip data into select categories where checkins are partitioned based on the date range
- [x] Filter right side list
- [x] When you select a trip filter the "Unique Countries" stats should be removed, or just remove that stat all together
- [x] Incorporate star ratings
- [x] Search filter (debounced)
- [x] When navigating to a new trip, center on the closest marker to the trip center rather than the center of the trip itself
